To compile and run a single Rust `.rs` file, follow these steps:
1. **Install Rust**: If you haven't already, install Rust using `rustup`. You can find the installation instructions for your operating system at [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **Navigate to the directory**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your `.rs` file is located. For example, if your file is in a `rust` directory in your current working directory, you can use `cd rust`.
3. **Compile the file**: Use the `rustc` compiler to compile your `.rs` file. For a file named `main.rs`, you would run `rustc main.rs`. This will generate an executable file in the same directory.
4. **Run the program**: On macOS and Linux, if your executable is named `main` (the default name when compiling `main.rs`), you can run it with `./main`. On Windows, you can run the generated `.exe` file.
